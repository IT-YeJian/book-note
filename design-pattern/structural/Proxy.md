## Overview
The Proxy [1] design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known GoF design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

What problems can the Proxy design pattern solve? [2]

- The access to an object should be controlled .
- Additional functionality should be provided when accessing an object.
When accessing sensitive objects, for example, it should be possible to check that clients have the needed access rights.

What solution does the Proxy design pattern describe?
Define a separate Proxy object that

- can be used as substitute for another object (Subject) and
- implements additional functionality to control the access to this subject.
This enables to work through a Proxy object to perform additional functionality when accessing a subject. For example, to check the access rights of clients accessing a sensitive object.
To act as substitute for a subject, a proxy must implement the Subject interface. Clients can't tell whether they work with a subject or its proxy.

~~~java
interface Image {
    public void displayImage();
}

// On System A
class RealImage implements Image {

    private String filename = null;
    /**
     * Constructor
     * @param filename
     */
    public RealImage(final String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
        loadImageFromDisk();
    }

    /**

     */
    private void loadImageFromDisk() {
        System.out.println("Loading   " + filename);
    }

    /**
     * Displays the image
     */
    public void displayImage() {
        System.out.println("Displaying " + filename);
    }

}

// On System B

    private RealImage image = null;

           image = new RealImage(filename);
        }
        image.displayImage();
    }

}

class ProxyExample {

   public static void main(final String[] arguments) {
        final Image image1 = new ProxyImage("HiRes_10MB_Photo1");
        final Image image2 = new ProxyImage("HiRes_10MB_Photo2");

        image1.displayImage(); // loading necessary
        image1.displayImage(); // loading unnecessary
        image2.displayImage(); // loading necessary
        image2.displayImage(); // loading unnecessary
        image1.displayImage(); // loading unnecessary
