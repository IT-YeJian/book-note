## What problems can the Bridge design pattern solve? [3]

- An abstraction and its implementation should be defined and extended independently from each other.
- A compile-time binding between an abstraction and its implementation should be avoided so that an implementation can be selected at run-time.
When using subclassing, different subclasses implement an abstract class in different ways. But an implementation is bound to the abstraction at compile-time and can't be changed at run-time.

## What solution does the Bridge design pattern describe?

- Separate an abstraction (Abstraction) from its implementation (Implementor) by putting them in separate class hierarchies.
- Implement the Abstraction in terms of (by delegating to) an Implementor object.
This enables to configure an Abstraction with an Implementor object at run-time.
